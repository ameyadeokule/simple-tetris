# Main Aim

To practice React by completing the challenges in the book [https://50reactprojects.com] (50 Projects For React & The Static Web). HOPE I CAN COMPLETE SOME GOOD PROJECTS.

## Project Aim

Create a tetris-like game that requires someone to rotate shapes to fit like a puzzle.

Tretis is a puzzle game that never seems to go out of style. Regardless of the theme, at its core, tetris is made up of shape of blocks that you need to use to complete rows to avoid overflowing the available space.
